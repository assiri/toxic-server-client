368d860ea44c0727, mangled units of  trans mission speed can anyone explain what units cuteftp uses for speed i see kbs and mbs in the cuteftp queue window for example  but these are not valid units  kbs suggests kilo byte seconds or kilo bit seconds but both are nonsense units  should be either kbps or kb s similarly  mbs suggests milli byte seconds or milli bit seconds which is doubly nonsense both because it is a nonsense unit and also because  even if they mean mbps or mb s  it is a ridiculously small unit i realize that they probably mean mega rather than milli but then they should use capital m baud used to be used universally for data  trans mission rates  and that is  at least  unambiguous this is all very sloppy and  of course  does not reflect well on globalscape see data rate units  also see bit rate  si prefix  binary prefix  list of device bandwidths ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

bcfdfddce1fe4403,march utc  an event horizon is any surface from beyond which no information can ever reach the observer of course  that includes objects of all kinds in fact  anything moving at or below the speed of light so in a sense you re right an important thing to note though is that the event horizon in the strictest sense belongs to the observer  rather than the thing  not  being observed in the case of a black hole  the event horizon is the same for all outside observers  which i guess is what you mean by a  physical boundary the event horizon article is biased towards this  the most commonly encountered form of event horizon the cosmological event horizon is different  since every point in the universe is receding from every other point with a speed proportional to distance  the event horizon is always a sphere centred on a particular observer  so there is no single  event horizon of the universe although of course we tend to give a special place to our own event horizon so neither article is wrong  although the introduction to event horizon gives a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the term  which i ll try to fix the cosmological use is however mentioned in event horizon event horizon of the observable universe there are more details in cosmological horizon and particle horizon ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1f2fb372744e39cc, it does not matter if they disclaim it s truthfulness  what matters is if they adhere to its teachings  there are some within the church  sadly  who do not believe the book of mormon to be true rather they believe it is inspired  non historical scripture  or that it contains good teachings  some of these would say the book of mormon is the word of god  others may not  however  they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to mormonism  i agree that coc are moving farther and farther away from mormonism  but until they completely turn away from the history  culture and teachings they are still a part of mormonism  please note i didn t say they were mormons  but rather adherents to mormonism  the term mormon in its connotation is narrow enough now to refer to members of the lds church and its th century offshoots  not most of the pre offshoots  it is npov to say they adhere to mormonism  but not to say they are mormons  i am willing to stand by that unless convinced otherwise feel free to ask your friend nov utc ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
