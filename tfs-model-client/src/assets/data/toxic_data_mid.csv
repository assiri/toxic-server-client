9a70f2c3b9d16f5b,  dear federico  when i have the time  and i promise i ll make the time  i ll delete any true ad hominem remarks dense would be a good example not only do they not belong on wikipedia  but as a student of logic  it is a classic logical fallacy to use an ad hominem remark to form an argument  but as i said  i feel passionately about the subject  and it has brought out the worst in me however  certain comments i will not remove  a claim of hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark  it s a statement that one s views are contradictory  that proposes one standard for one case  and another standard for another  as such hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark  rather it is used to describe inconsistent statements or behaviour for example  you mention that you have to show me where the statistics of historians opinions about hiroshima and nagasaki decision is  does it include soviet historians  japanese historians  chinese historians  south american historians  east and west european historians  africans historians  arab  indian historians  or only include u s  army historians  even in that case  opinion of the majority is still opinion  not fact  fair enough  but later on you say it s been stated many times that the americans were only thinking of saving american lives through the a bomb  the japanese never came into it  they did not care at all about japanese lives  so your reasoning is invalid  who said this  you impose such high criteria for my statement that the a bomb saved human lives  requiring experts from all over the world  but soon after you baldly assert that my reasoning is invalid because it s been stated many times  stated many times by who  according to your very own criteria  you need to provide evidence from soviet historians  japanese historians  chinese historians  south american historians  east and west european historians  africans historians  arab and indian historians  but you don t  you merely state it s been stated many times therefore my reasoning is invalid  apparently loomis has to provide sources  but we can take federico s word for it w hate ver he says  that  my dear friend  is hypocrisy  and you  my dear friend  are a hypocrite for reasoning in such a way  calling you a hypocrite is therefore not an ad hominem remark and i therefore will not remove it and by the way  thank you for pointing out my typo when i put a k in the word recognize again  it seems that when loomis makes the slightest spelling typo  its fair game to point it out  but when federico makes numerous spelling  grammar  syntactical etc  mistakes  its impolite to recognize and show sensitivity towards the fact that english is not federico s first language i have more to say but unfortunately i have an appointment  hopefully i ll get back in time to finish this before you read it  in the mean time  i truly mean it when i say that i consider myself a soft spoken  agreeable person  isn t all this mea culpa proof on anything  speak to you later and all the best  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

58d67ba8d7ba4e5f, regarding the speedy deletion of my entry for the resonance project  i am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper talk process  i have no affiliation with the resonance project aside from nassim haramein s lectures giving some validation to ideas i have been thinking about for a long time  but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about  at times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris  and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed either way it s flat earth society type behaviour that i find objectionable i understand your points but disagree  particularly on the notability aspect i can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than the resonance project on wikipedia i am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called community instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it  and by doing so silenced my opinions thats wrong and although a comment made by another editor stated that i had a chance to contest the speedy deletion i could find no such option when you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar  and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas  then you have a problem wikipedia you have a problem  and if i can t get entries for nassim haramein and the resonance project in i am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of wikipedia  the not so free encyclopedia  wake up  wikipedia editors open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world  not another puppet this new field of spiritual science or unified physics  w hate ver you want to call it  is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not there are thriving social media communities of individuals on both the resonance project and hassim harramein s facebook pages  and yet wikipedia via it s ignorant  sorry it s true  editors quickly dismiss as not notable it s notable enough for people to include the information provided by nassim haramein and the resonance project in their social media feeds  who are you to dismiss so many people s opinions people think about that if i gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the wikipedia editorial drones ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ae727aa7d848f335,  there isn t really an easy way to do this  i generally use a combination of illustrator cs and a text editor  and any knowledge on basic svg specifications for basic types  such as default parameter values  so that certain data can be excluded i used to use inkscape  but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated svg code it is sad to say  since i support free software  that i really appreciate illustrator  since it is slick and produces very clean svg code  certainly  adobe authored the svg specifications  so it is not surprising that illustrator writes the best output  in my opinion however  when opening svg files in illustrator that were originally saved in the inscape svg format  illustrator will usually retain the sodipodi metadata  which is specific only to that application  and inkscape i try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard svg coding  then reopen save in illustrator  another method is to save the figure as an illustrator ai or pdf file  then reopen save in illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata  if this fails  and it is a simple circle  i redraw the object  often i ll name objects  but remove layer since multiple layers are not needed for logos  if you can  find original artwork in pdf format  and simply open it up in illustrator  and edit then save in svg  this way you can avoid doing too much tweaking to get around inkscape s annoyances t  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ce771080ccaadf8c,wikipedia is a source of information on a huge range of issues and topics  many of which do not get an airing in conventional references  it is particularly useful in providing details on obscure flags across the planet that are not often featured in standard works included in wikipedia s annals are the flags for example  of khuzestani arabs  ethnic somalis in kenya the bakonjo of uganda  the turks of western thrace some decidedly obscure banners but i am grateful to wikipedia contributors for providing information on these myriad groups which  allows me to know exactly whom these designs represent and understand the context when i see them aloft on news reports and elsewhere  why therefore are we to be denied similar access to information concerning the extant flag in the english county of dorset the fact is that a gold flag with a red edged white cross  designated the dorset cross can be seen flying across the county  it is also a fact that the town council in the dorset town of wimborne has embraced this as their preferred county flag  the design is therefore a tangible reality  that has evident popularity and the full support of a local authority  what factor in these circumstances makes the dorset cross ineligible for inclusion in wikipedia  one might argue that the dorset cross is not an official flag how many of the examples cited above can claim to be official  the four snakes and cross flag depicted in the entry on martinique in fact specifically states that this is an unofficial region flag however  one presumes that it actually flies in the island i e  it exists and is possessed of a certain popularity and is therefore worthy of note  how does the circumstance in dorset differ  as in martinique  the dorset cross flag is not official  as in martinque  the flag can be seen flying in many places  how is this flag then not worthy of mention or depiction in wikipedia  a trawl across the internet reveals that there are two flags currently commercially available as dorset flags one is a banner of the arms of the county council  which design the general public is not legally entitled to fly  the other is the dorset cross  which the public demonstrably are flying but this reality is not being reflected in wikipedia  where we currently have an illustration of the banner of the arms but none of the dorset cross this strikes me as imbalanced and tendentious the dorset cross is a contender in a current competition held under the auspices of the dorset county council to select a flag that they will themselves endorse  the competition itself is of course worthy of mention and when all the contenders are revealed they should of course all appear in wikipedia but the fact is that notwithstanding said competition  the dorset cross is already flying and predates the competition and wikipedia  in not allowing its depiction is guilty of misinformation  one relies on wikipedia to advise that the flag of the dinka is a five striped horizontal design and takes such advice on good faith  how odd therefore that one should not be similarly able to consult this resource on a flag that one can see flying in the streets and all about user vexilo,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ababbfa8411b5b7c, and how conveniently  after it was the ip that threatened me of admin actions jjust a few hours ago  it s actually buspar that is coming to complain to an admin  and we re not hearing from the ip as if the persons were one and the same i find it strange that buspar is so familiar with what the ip did only a few hours ago  and rushed to complain here  while he has not been contacted by the ip as if  by magic  he read every article that the ip has edited  please jehochman  explain me how could all this be possible without buspar being the ip anyway  it s buspar that is harassing me  he s systematically tracking down every single one of my edits in articles about illegal fan  trans lations and distributions of copyrighted material  so that he could rush to revert them and provoke me at the same time  then threatening to complain to admins  then  saying edit warring under his username wouldn t work  he s started using anonymous ips so that his reverts would go unnoticed among the other edits  then he has used his ips to try to game a consensus discussion  pretending there was various people against me while it was only him against me let me be clear  there has already been a sockpuppet check on buspar  the admin that was in charge of the case never denied that buspar could be the ips  instead  the admin stated  and i quote  looking at contribs  user buspar and user xuanwu are very probably the same user user buspar s userpage clearly states i ve been editing wiki off and on with various user names since i don t like sticking with a user name too long  because i ve found that people start reacting to the user name more than the quality of the edits after a bit  as i ve said  the admin never denied or confirmed that buspar wasn t using the ips listed as aliases  however  anyone that had to deal with you concerning articles will spot you right away  strangely and buspar both appear to be very active on the very same articles  ron paul presidential campaign okashina okashi strange candy  signum  nanoha also  both of them seem to have a tendency of being involved in heated debates with me concerning illegal fan  trans lations and distributions of copyrighted material  strangely  both users  interventions in these cases tended to add pov statements in favor of illegal downloading while i tried to prevent this  as it was an obvious violations of policies  and i m again stating that if he s buspar  then calling him by one of his username is not an offence  it would be if he wasn t buspar  but this remain to be proved  the only thing is that i don t like him using an anonymous ip when he s reverting my contributions  because i like honesty  and hiding under anonymity when attacking me is never a sign of good faith  i m only reestablishing his identity  which  if he s buspar  cannot be an attack in any way  you ll note that i m not going after every edit of the ip in order to call it buspar  however he s always there as soon as i edit an article like fansub fandub scanlation i m merely reacting when he s targetting my edits  i realize  however  that i might not have chosen the best way to deal with the matter  so to calm things down  i offer to stop calling him buspar if that s what he d like  under the condition that either him or an admin acknowledge that buspar and the ip are indeed linked  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

a95dba0602cabcca,dolls robots  as the article stands right now  the lede has absolutely no mention of dolls or robots the entire article doesn t contain a single mention of the word  robot i have made persistent efforts  most recent  toward rectifying this  but each time my edits have been reverted rationale for the removal included the view that i was adding original research and that my additions were not wp lede compliant in that there was no mention of robots within the body of the article for editors who strive to increase the quality of wikipedia  it is clear to me that the most helpful action to take for these valid criticisms  instead of simply hitting the  revert  button  is this statement in lede is unsupported  fix flag as needing a reference  i found a great book with a single googling lede is discussing a topic that is not discussed in the article s body  fix add a statement or two into the body i realize that these approaches to fixes require putting in a little more effort  but that s the direction that leads to higher quality articles instead of preserving the gaping holes in them last point if there s an edit instability regarding the quality of an article  it is clear to me that the best place to initiate a talk discussion is on the article s talk page and not any particular user s talk page  ie  mine this way other editors who care about the issue in question are not required to go hunting around in order to get up to speed on w hate ver disagreements had  trans pired now if the issue is that a particular user is vandalizing an article  then that would be an excellent reason to open a discussion on the usertalk page and keep the article talk insulated from irrelevant noise ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

f42828ccf3249763,kristof the problem here is a lag from the old ukrainian orthography that has since changed  a similar case existed in belarus  but much more amplified  when the changes of s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled  example minsk and mensk  in fact that is the reason why there are two versions of belarusian edition wikipedia  one uses the old and the other the official adopted version  in ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent  and only some cities were affected e g  rivne became rovno  luhanske became luhansk  konotip became konotop and so on  with our city as far as i am aware it too became during the s some of those changes were reversed  and it really falls to because in ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects  in fact if you compare western and central ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of british and american english  so for some cases like rivne  it was much up to the locals  because volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled  whilst somewhere in poltava they will say it as rovno  it seems that with mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide  but then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as sevatopil but that is outright stupid  because even in classic orthography that version would never be used  the  pil originates from the connotation of field like ternopil  the  pol comes from the greek root for city  like sevastopol  all the more reasons why we should stick to mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

71fb0e2757a9f6e9, question about maltose binding protein article hi victor just now i m solving this problem with respect to this maltose binding protein tag  i found this article on wiki  and here is what you wrote  once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form the protein of interest  x  is often cleaved from mbp with a specific protease  protein x can then be separated from mbp by passing through the amylose column again  it would be great if you can explain how can protein x can then be separated from mbp by passing through the amylose column again because i have tried it and it doesn t work  my personal guess is since mbp binds to maltose  it simply doesn t bind to amylose resins column unless maltose is removed beforehand then the question is how to remove maltose from mbp  from davidson et al  mechanism of maltose  trans port in escherichia coli trans membrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins preparation of maltose free mbp  mbp was purified by affinity chromatography and was dialyzed extensively under conditions calculated to remove most of the bound maltose  for some experiments  mbp was denatured in  m guanidine hydrochloride  gdn hcl  and either dialyzed against  m gdn hcl or passed through a sephadex g column equilibrated with  m gdn hcl before renaturation by dialysis against mm kp ph uv difference spectroscopy showed that the bulk of the mbp was free of maltose  hope to hear from you soon martin ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ca91c3b3d06afd3d, proposed revision of the controversy section though controversy shouldn t consume the bulk of the article  i think the revised section is somewhat awkwardly written and neglects the substance of the criticisms  it can be rewritten for greater clarity  and to include the quotes that have actually generated the controversy  it is just false to say conservative bloggers are basing their criticisms on a single line from his book  but if it were true  shouldn t that line be quoted too  the section can be kept short  while not excluding the content of criticisms  i propose the following text lloyd has been targeted by conservative commentators such as glenn beck  with the aim of forcing him to resign  as happened with former white house adviser van jones beck broadcast a video of lloyd s comments at a conference on media reform  in which he described the rise of venezuelan president hugo chavez as really an incredible revolution  conservatives view this as an expression of support for chavez  though lloyd has stated that he does not support him  conservative bloggers have also attacked lloyd s commitment to free speech  based largely on quotes from his book prologue to a farce  communication and democracy in america  in which he writes that the first amendment should be placed in context with other communications policies  and on his article forget the fairness doctrine  discussing clear proposals to address the gap between conservative and progressive talk  over non partisan public interest groups have defended lloyd  calling conservative claims false and misleading  this is only about words longer than the present version  but i believe it does much more to inform readers about the controversy  since the controversy section of this article is so controversial  however  i ll leave my rewrite here for a day or two before implementing it  it s always easier to see bias against your own point of view  so i hope some liberals can improve on my text  but the current version is just not accurate or informative ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2689d81ac5d49a46, dispute i noticed there s an edit war going on with regard to the debunkingprimaltherapy link  and the link at the end of the primal therapy section my opinion is as follows  i think the link at the end of the primal therapy section should lead to the primal therapy article  not to the criticism section specifically  i feel that way because the section in the page entitled primal therapy is relevant to the entire primal therapy article  including the criticisms  and not to the criticisms alone it would be quite possible to have both links at the bottom of the paragraph see primal therapy  including the criticism section i wouldn t be opposed to that  personally i don t believe that the section primal therapy should be on the biography page at all  we should have a link only arthur janov is the creator of  linked  primal therapy  and author of many books on that subject imo there is no need to discuss primal therapy  or its criticisms  in any detail on a biography page  because those things are not biographical details  they are not relevant here  they belong in the primal therapy article  and there is no need to repeat that article here with regard to the dbt com link  i don t believe this page is an appropriate place for any kind of dispute about primal therapy  one way or the other  since this article is not about primal therapy  i don t believe that we should include here links to any sites unless they are specifically relevant to the biography of arthur janov  if we do have any such links like the dbt com link  then we must revisit the whole debate here  and we must include other links  otherwise we violate npov by representing only one side  it would be better just not to have such links bear in mind that art janov is an exceedingly minor historical figure  his biography should be only a few paragraphs  it s not really the best place for an extensive argument i realize you guys are concerned about people being led astray by reading the wiki  but i really don t think that s a major concern  anyone who follows a primal therapy link and reads the article will realize that primal therapy has been criticized  the readers aren t dense and don t need things repeated  in other words  i don t think anyone could be misled or led astray by a simple link  and nothing more  on the biography page we should achieve some kind of consensus before editing the article  if we can t achieve consensus then we should solicit outside opinion  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

a4dfbc44deba1856, i need your help dear luna santin  first of all  i want to say  you are the only administrator that has shown any respect to me  and for that  i come to ask that you help me overcome this outstanding prejudice directed toward myself by the many pompous admins that continue to block me and harass me unfairly  while i have made mistakes in the past  i assure you i am committed to only contributing to wikipedia  i am angry because the last time i was  block  was completely unfair  i was issued a warning because i posted i love you on two users talk pages  while they took this as a joke  i took it as my try to make peace with these people that i felt wronged me in the past  i m sorry if love is considered a joke around here  while i tried explaining that i should not be warned for something like this  they decided they did not want to hear the radical idea that they were exerting their overzealous attitude towards me  instead of being responsible admins  as a result  they decided to keep me quiet by blocking me for a week  while on this ban  they decided to accuse me of having a sockpuppet  because this user claimed he was me in an edit  everybody knows a sockpuppet would not admit he is one in his own edit  since they foolishly thought this user was a sockpuppet of mine  they extended the block to month  to further keep me quiet  i  obviously finding this as unfair  decided to request an unblock  because an accusation that has no actual evidence is no reason to extend the block  since this was a way of me speaking out  they rejected and even protected my page  which is why you may not be able to respond on my page until the user decides to unprotect it  i hope you can get back to me  and really help me out  i feel mistreated  and  as a person that cannot stand unjust people and a person that fights for what is right  i want to fight this  so that this whole mishap is solved  if you can help in any way  that would be appreciated  i know that i might even get  block  again for writing this letter  since it involves me speaking out against the almighty admins  even though what i am speaking out against  is wrong  thank you  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

589756daab94fd0c, well  stricker actually has a finding of research misconduct against him he fudged data to get an nejm paper that was retracted by his three co authors when they found out what he did as a consequence  was barred by the ori from receiving or applying for federal grants for three years in the s so he s previously gotten into serious trouble for throwing out data that doesn t fit his preferred hypothesis  in recent years  his publications seem to be almost exclusively low impact papers  opinion bits  and letters related to morgellons and the related dubious diagnosis of chronic lyme disease i suppose it s possible that he might be leading his field but if so it s taking an awfully long time for anyone to start following it s looking much more like he s just wandering in the wilderness  and the advent of the open peer review journals  where the journal publicly posts the identities and sometimes the comments of peer reviewers  opens a window on at least some mild shena nigger  ns regarding reviewer selection in some of his recent papers this f paper has a publisher s note about an undisclosed conflict of interest  where one of the reviewers was co authoring another manuscript with the paper s authors while reviewing the f paper and one of the reviewers of the current paper  bmc dermatology was robert bransfield who is actually acknowledged in the paper for his contributions this sort of thing has a couple of likely explanations stricker  et al are deliberately pointing journal editors at very friendly peer reviewers  and these mostly crappy  low impact journals don t do much due diligence potential conflicts of interest be damned  or these papers are so far out on the fringe that it s very difficult for journal editors to find anyone who is willing to waste time on reviewing manuscripts on these topics  so they re relaxed about their reviewer standards  or both talk ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

01726bfc7b29b8c9, tim  firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline  and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour  yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in  there is clearly a massive diffence between  say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions  or between the chinese and u s  jurisdictions  since the legal and regulatory systems are very different  as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets  beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in  say  paris or toulouse  even though they are both in the same jurisdiction  i appreciate that the situation in the u s  is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions  even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though  to give an example  the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market  but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist  niche and focused on high tech  to give another example  in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn t have an office in london  even if it had offices in every other big city  in fact all of the very top tier uk firms  dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them  despite its size  have just one uk office  in london  although they have other offices overseas  saying that dla has has offices across the united states  egypt  south africa  kenya  thailand  china would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader  we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesary element of vagueness  imprecision and even original research  i do accept that dla  with offices  is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article  however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it  and should be included as much as possible  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

53b4ab9411873601,the possibility intrigues me too  its quite tight  the diagram is roughly to scale and there is about yards clear between ships yards long  but it could be done  if camperdown had arranged to pass just behind victoria it should have worked  what we need is someone experienced with fleet handling who could give a view on whether it would work i think what actually happened to the other ships after the collision shows it would have been possible for the two columns to turn inwards very tight without colliding or crossing  but only by taking extreme measures  ie turning by reversing one screw victoria seems to have signalled she was doing a tight turn without engines  there were signaling devices to indicate if engines were reversed markham seems to have started off  with a textbook standard turn and then panicked too late  trying to turn faster  i thinkat the time the suggestion that the lines might have crossed was dismissed  but then  would a court martial made up of the people involved have come to the conclusion that there was a simple workable solution which would have avoided the sinking  what i like most about the scissors is its elegance  it is so in keeping with tryons style  its not quite true to say the captains did nothing  there is testimony that some at least made preparation for a very tight screw turn  but their job was to follow the ship in front ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

50425a1359c55ed8, kickstart disks the current article states  subsequent amiga models all used rom chips following the a in relation to kickstart however  i remember that the amiga also required such a kickstart disk  can anyone confirm  thanks most a  s used roms  but some  like mine  had a small super kickstart in rom which read kickstart from floppy or hard disk super kickstart was based on amigaos which never appeared anywhere else iirc  only the machines manufactured in europe had super kickstart but i may well be wrong on that detail  i do know that i never got my machine to boot a v  x amigaos cheers talk freeing memory this is relevant to a different wikipedia article i have the statement in front of me that  when a program terminates in amigaos  memory assigned by the program is not freed  and that it is therefore vital for the program to release all memory that it asked for  otherwise it is permanently leaked is this the case memory that is not freed before termination of a program in the amiga os is leaked  assuming it was supposed to be freed in some cases a program may have allocated structures and attached them to system objects  such as a device node one of the most common modes of testing on the amiga was checking free memory after program exit  there were many tools that automated that normal behavior of a program was to free all memory  and all malloc d memory was automatically freed via exit time hooks  i e  leaking memory typically only happened to memory obtained via allocmem and the like  indeed  amigaos does little to no resource tracking in order to save the memory overhead that it costs to include tracking  there was also a third party program that patched many allocate free resource functions  e g  allocmem freemem  openwindow closewindow  and added resource tracking to them  however this would break any software that deliberately allocate memory then exited  for example programs which installed patches on system functions  programs assume the responsibility for freeing all allocated memory  the standard c library implementation in most amiga c compilers used an onexit handler that freed any memory allocated with the malloc implementation  but if the program crashed or the amigaos memory allocation routines were called directly  memory allocations were not freed  other languages had varying degrees of support for tracking memory  usually  like c  only if you used the language specific memory allocators  thank you for your replies  the reason for the question relates to a discussion i ve been having on memory leak  i m going to post a question which is very subjective  but maybe there s a consensus  the article includes in modern operating systems  normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates part of the debate is over whether this is really true  and whether it should say in some operating systems the leading question is  is amigaos a modern operating system a supplementary dispute  where it says the application assumes that the request for memory has succeeded  and continues on this basis  this will typically result in an access violation but in some cases may result in damaging information belonging to this or  in primitive systems  some other application  should this have some systems in place of primitive systems thanks in advance  the amiga would be included in modern operating systems and it does release normal memory i e  malloced  when the application ends program crashes on an amiga do not release memory  so you could say it leaks on process crash and a program that uses things like openfile instead of open will leak a filehandle  and some memory  if the program calls exit without closing the file as for your second question  the answer would be some systems many modern embedded systems  including running unix variants like uclinux  do not have memory protection  and can read  and possibly write  structures using null as a pointer without an access violation personally  i  hate  programs that don t check malloc  or any other calls  for failure good programming practice on the amiga  due to the lack of vm  was to test programs and the os against random memory allocation failures to see if they recovered cleanly or not all allocations  and all system calls  etc  should be checked for failure and,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

14a3a815e24b78f1,abuse hello  i was recently banned and then rebanned for a fortnight and then banned from contacting others or even writing on my own talk page i feel that serious abuses have occurred and my account clearly shows who was abusing their tools the final block of me being able to even write on my own talk page about how i was  block  unjustly and the inherent problems that i could spot in the process really took the cake and i think that moderator named tarc  but the others too  need to be seriously reprimanded and even stripped of their tools because this was serious abuse of power and it was taken to an excessive level that shows clear abuse i think can you please advise me on what to do to follow up on this because i believe this is of the highest importance to wikipedia integrity  thank you  johnhistory,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

fdb92355c15972fd,those claims were reinserted with sources  but the sources themselves were problematic and i have again removed that material  i do not know portuguese  but this article fails to support some of the more lurid claims made in a paragraph about some explicit videotapes  phrases cited do not appear at all in that source i m not certain  but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all  as from what i can gather it basically is discussing his work  this appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life  though taveira is discussed on that page  and the claim could be true  we cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though the blp issues here are significant  as are questions of weight  since most of the previous version of the article was given over to controversy rather than a discussion of his career  please do not re add the material in question without discussing it here on the talk page  i d also appreciate a note on my talk page if such a discussion begins  though i have watchlisted this we almost certainly need better sources  and we also need help from portuguese speaking editors  talk contribs,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
